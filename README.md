This python program allows you to automatically modify print files (usually .gcode files) in order to push your prints using the printers tool head at the end of the print.
This could potentially damage your printer and/or your parts if used incorrectly, please make sure you adapt each instruction within the script to your own machine.
Use at your own risk.
